## ABSTRACT

Characterising complex networks on interacting species is challenging. Two major stumbling blocks are a) correctly identifying species identity and b) having a sufficient sampling size for detecting all occurring links. A revisión of recently published plant-pollinator networks shows that most published networks group several species into morphospecies or even work at the genus level. In addition, when evaluated, sampling completness is never reached. This has clear implications for describing the network structure, but it is unknown how it affects relative comparisions among networks. Ecologists are often more interested in the relative comparision among communities with contrasting environments or treatments rather than in the absolute values. When two networks are sampled using the same methods, low taxonomic resolution and limited sampling effort may not change its relative comparision, but this has never been tested empirically. I use an intensive sampling of 16 fully resolved plant-pollinator networks acorss an environmental gradient to compare if the relative ranking of the main network propierties changes when increasing taxonomic resolution (from morphospecies tos species) and sampling effort. Then, I tested to which degree recently developed techniques for predicting missing links enhance the relative coparisions of poorly sampled networks. Determining which methods and indexes are robust to relative comparisions is needed in order to empirically test for pressing environmental changes that interacting communities are facing.





# INTRODUCTION





# METHODS

Material and Methods:
We selected 16 sites in the southwest of the iberian peninsula (Huelva and Seville) for the samplings. These sites were selected from very low modified sites to very modified having crops and houses nearby (Table S.X). A site was selected when they had enough flowering plants that could attract pollinators (Cistus sp., Lavandula sp., Rosmarinus officinalis, Myrtus communis).

We used pollinators because is a system that [...]
All the pollinators were collected and noted in 2015 from March to June using three sampling methods. The sampling was divided by seven rounds, each round consisted in sampling each one of the 16 sites once by three types of censuses. The first census was the linear transect, in which we went through a 100 m straight line during 30 minutes in which we wrote down every plant-pollinator interaction seen. Those bees and plants that we were unable to identify were collected by hand-netting. The second type of census was the focal census. We selected plants with enough flowers from Cistus sp., Lavandula sp., Rosmarinus officinalis and Myrtus communis  and did 5 minutes census in which we wrote down every interaction seen, also capturing species unable to identify from the naked eye for later identification. Finally, to complete the census for the site, we also did an out of transect census, depending on the availability seen of pollinators in the previous censuses and flowers, we walked around flower patches to identify and capture unidentified species

Due to the amount of bees captured we conserved them frozen in the cooler at -20ºC, then they were pinned and labeled in the lab. Later we identify them using the scarce taxonomic information through determination keys. All the species were sent to a taxonomic expert to check the identification done and to identify the remaining unidentified species.
