# Dataton

This is a repo to explore colaboratively data on plant pollinator networks and see how many sampling effort we do really need. This will take place 26-28 June in a cabin in the woods. All bartomeus lab members are invited. However, if you would like to contribute online, drop me a note and we can work it out.
